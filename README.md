# Writing Angular 1 code in TypeScript sample app

In our [previous article](http://blog.priceandcost.com/development/using-typescript-with-angular-1/) on Angular and TypeScript we started off from scratch and created a small Angular application that had one controller written in TypeScript. Now it is time to look at how would one write Angular 1 code in TypeScript so that it is readable and easy to maintain.

This repository contains sample code for the blog post [TypeScript tutorial with examples of Angular controller, directive and service](https://slack-redir.net/link?url=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.priceandcost.com%2Fdevelopment%2Ftypescript-tutorial-with-examples-of-angular-controller-directive-and-service%2F&v=3).

# Usage
Clone this repository, install npm dependencies and serve the application as follows:

```
git clone https://github.com/priceandcost/writing-angular-1-code-in-typescript-sample
cd writing-angular-1-code-in-typescript-sample
npm install
npm start
```
